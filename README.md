# Blue Minimal Theme

Since LineAgeOS doesn't support themes till now, I decided to make a Substratum compatible theme. Using Substratum theme engine can cause bootloops. Use at own risk.

If you want more themed icons I need the source code of the app (so I will support only free software). Just open an issue with the link to the source code.

### What is themed:

- choose accent color of general UI
- Settings: color of icons
- Calendar: some icons
- Contacts: primary color is blue
- Dialer: primary color is blue
- Calculator: blue/orange
- Icons of several apps

### Included:

- Overlays (see above)
- Boot anmiations (Blue Minimal/LineAgeOS)
- Sounds
- Fonts (Fira norma and thin)
